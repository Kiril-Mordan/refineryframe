Plans for near future
- more comprehensive text data cleaning methods
- error break ability for detect unexpected
- use case documents
- shoutOUT standard for every print
- code optimization (for deduplication)

Performance tests:
- generate large dataset of mimic data (small, medium, large size) (relatively clean, super unlean)
- enritch dataframe with unexpected values, randomly or in specific pattern
- generate profiling report
-
