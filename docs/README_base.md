The goal of the package is to simplify life for data scientists, that have to deal with imperfect raw data. The package suppose to detect and clean unexpected values, while doubling as safeguard in production code based on predifined conditions that arise from business assumptions or any other source. The package is well suited to be an initial preprocessing step in ml pipelines situated between data gathering and training/scoring steps.
