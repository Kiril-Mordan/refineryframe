Plans for near future
- clean up the documentation
- more comprehensive text data cleaning methods
- use case documents
- shoutOUT standard for every print
- performace tests
- code optimizations

Performance tests:
- generate large dataset of mimic data (small, medium, large size) (relatively clean, super unlean)
- enritch dataframe with unexpected values, randomly or in specific pattern
- generate profiling report
